Active Sensors: An active sensor is one which transmits a signal into the environment and then measures the response that comes back.
Something that you could use this for is maybe a trail cam. Because it is always on and is always sending a signal but then snaps a picture when something moves.
Passive Sensors: A passive sensor is one which just ‘listens’ to what is happening.
A good example of a passive sensor is an alexa from amazon. Because it just listens for the voice command to start working.
Proprioceptive Sensors: A proprioceptive sensor measures values internal to the system (robot).
An example of a Proprioceptive sensor is an I Phone. When your phone gets super hot it sends a signal to your screen saying your phone needs to cool down so it is sensing the inside heat.
Exteroceptive Sensors: An Exteroceptive sensor acquires information from the robot’s environment.
An example of this is the 3rd robot we made. It basically senses the humidity in the enviroment. This could be super useful in a big factory where you can't always watch thing so you could just put a sensor in it and if it goes over the suggested humidity or anything like that it would send a signal that something is wrong.
