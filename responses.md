What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?
The sensor is sending out a signal to the exteroceptiv sensors send out an external signal which tells the sensor what its surrondings are.
What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?
For the humidity one is that if it is too hot or anything it might not sense how humid it is or it might be too hot for the sensor to understand it and get it wrong.
What role does coding play in this process?
The coding basically makes it work. It is also nice because you can change stuff in the code that might not be working correctly.
